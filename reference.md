### Absence from Classes
Attendance is a basic assessment requirement for credit award, and failure to attend classes or meetings with academic staff may result in your losing the right to be assessed in that module. Please ensure that you are familiar with the 'Academic Alert' policy as stated elsewhere in this handbook.  If you have missed timetabled classes/events or any other compulsory elements of the module due to illness or an unavoidable pre-arranged event or appointment, you must complete a Self Certificate of Absence form (through e-Vision) as soon as possible.

Under certain circumstances, Schools may request further documentation in addition to the Self Certificate. In this case, students should contact Student Services in order to organise the appropriate documentation.  If you submit more than three Self Certificates in a single semester, or if the period of absence extends to fifteen working days, you may be contacted by Student Services, the relevant Pro Dean, or by an appropriate member of staff in your School.

Completion of a Self Certificate is not an acceptable substitute for contacting your tutors well in advance if you have to be absent. Advance notice of absence is acceptable only for good reason (for example, a hospital appointment or job interview). It is your responsibility to contact the appropriate member of staff to complete any remedial work necessary.

If you are an international student (non-EEA nationals only), you will be affected by recent changes introduced by the UK in relation to immigration rules and visas. The University is now legally bound to report to the UKVI any student who fails to enrol on a module or programme of study, or who fails to attend, or who discontinues their studies.

### Disability Support

If you require support for disability reasons, for example teaching and exam arrangements, please contact the Disability Team in Student Services who can provide support for a wide range of disabilities such as learning difficulties, visual and hearing impairments, mobility difficulties, Aspergerâ€™s, mental health, long standing medical condition and much more.

## Assignments

Your submitted work should meet the following requirements:

### Headers and Formatting

At the top of all your written work or on a cover page, please include:

* The date of submission
* The assignment you are submitting (e.g. Historiographical Essay, Empirical Research Essay, etc.)
* Your student number
* A title for your essay
* The total number of words including footnotes (use the word count feature of your word processor)

When formatting your assignments, please follow these guidelines:

* Add page numbers
* Use a minimum of 12 sized font
* Use a serif font (such as Times Roman, Georgia, Garamond), not a sans serif font (such as Arial, Helvetica, Verdana)
* Please double space your essays

Other aspects of formatting are highlighted in the School of History style sheet. See the following section.

### Footnotes and References

Please carefully read the St Andrews School of History Style Sheet:

http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/infoug/stylesheet.html

This document, sections 1-4, contains extremely valuable information on how to compose your essay, including how to format your footnotes and bibliography. Please note that failure to follow the style sheet can result in penalties on the final mark for the essay.

### Online Submission

Unless otherwise indicated, work will considered submitted by the date the document was submitted online on the MMS website for the course. 

If you are concerned that any given assignment was not correctly submitted to the MMS, you are free to email a copy of your submitted assignment to the module coordinator, if you like. In the event an assignment was not correctly uploaded to the MMS for some reason, but an emailed copy was sent in time, that date of submission will be used, but a copy will still need to be submitted to the MMS thereafter.

### Late Work

This module follows the official School of History penalties for late work:

### Word Limits

Assessed work with word limits should be always submitted within those limits. Writing in a clear and concise manner, and being able to structure and execute an argument that may be shorter than you feel is required is a skill that is of great use in academic fields as well as the workplace beyond. Please do not go over the limit and force yourself to work within them as a practice that will be important for writing assignments in your future careers. 

The official School of Histories penalties for short/long work are followed in this module:

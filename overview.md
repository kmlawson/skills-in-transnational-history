This module will equip MLitt students with skills necessary for historical research in the twenty-first century. Tailored specifically for students studying transnational, global and spatial history, the course will lead to the acquisition and development of skills in the digital humanities, and/or skills required for using specific historical sources. Students select two mini-modules from a range that includes GIS map-making; digital network analysis; translation; using non-textual sources. The course is distinctive in that it seeks to foster multi-disciplinary expertise among history students â€“ with the aim of developing innovative approaches to the sub-disciplines of transnational, global and spatial history.

### Description	

This module will equip MLitt students with skills necessary for historical research in the twenty-first century. Tailored specifically for students studying transnational, global and spatial history, the course will lead to the acquisition and development of skills in the digital humanities, and/or skills required for using specific historical sources. Students select two mini-modules from a range that includes GIS map-making; digital network analysis; translation; using non-textual sources. The course is distinctive in that it seeks to foster multi-disciplinary expertise among history students â€“ with the aim of developing innovative approaches to the sub-disciplines of transnational, global and spatial history.

*Map Project* (50%)

This assessment is designed to give you a chance to demonstrate your ability to effectively use QGIS to prepare map layers, produce exported maps for incorporation into a historical project; be able to articulate what the maps can be useful for; and be able to describe the limitations and problems associated with your map and the data on which it depends.

For Submission: You must upload, to the MMS: 

* 1,000-1,500 word explanatory essay which provides some basic historical background to the inspiration for the map project, discusses the ways in which the map can be used for heuristic, illustrative, or analytical purposes, and the limitations and problems with map. In other words, discuss both what the map might reveal, but also what it may potentially conceal or distort. Important: At the end of the essay or embedded into the essay should be the exported maps, with any post-processing required, such as you would want them to appear in a historical essay, with an appropriate caption.
* 500 word appendix must also be uploaded to the MMS which describes the technical process by which you assembled the QGIS project and its layers. What did you do to create each of the layers? Where exactly did you get the data for each of the layers and why did you choose that data over possible alternatives? What other technical steps did you carry out in order to produce the project?
* You must include a link to a place where the QGIS files can be downloaded (publicly accessible or shared Google Drive or Dropbox file link, or other file sharing resource) or else have submitted a USB drive on the previous meeting of class with the files.

Scope: The number of layers of data to include depends entirely on what map or maps are being created, that is what you are trying to show. It may consist of three or up to a dozen layers and may include natural coastal or topographical data, other features, and thematic data layers visualizing things. You may generate a single exported map if it is rich and complex, requiring a very significant amount of time in preparation or up to half a dozen different maps using different data or snapshots of data at a particular time if they can be used effectively for historical argumentation. Please consult with the tutor as your outputs become clear if you have questions about the scope.

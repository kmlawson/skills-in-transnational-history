### Description

This module will equip MLitt students with skills necessary for historical research in the twenty-first century. Tailored specifically for students studying transnational, global and spatial history, the course will lead to the acquisition and development of skills in the digital humanities, and/or skills required for using specific historical sources. Students select two mini-modules from a range that includes GIS map-making; digital network analysis; translation; using non-textual sources. The course is distinctive in that it seeks to foster multi-disciplinary expertise among history students – with the aim of developing innovative approaches to the sub-disciplines of transnational, global and spatial history.

### Assessment Summary

50% - 30 October - History Map Project QGIS Project File and accompanying files, 1,000-1,500 word explanatory essay and 500 word appendix  
50% - 15 December - Database file or excel spreadsheets + 1-5 visualizations, 1,500-2,000 word essay, visualisations, and 500 word appendix

**Map Project** (50%)

This assessment is designed to give you a chance to demonstrate your ability to effectively use QGIS to prepare map layers, produce exported maps for incorporation into a historical project; be able to articulate what the maps can be useful for; and be able to describe the limitations and problems associated with your map and the data on which it depends.

For Submission you must upload, to the MMS:

* 1,000-1,500 word explanatory essay which provides some basic historical background to the inspiration for the map project, discusses the ways in which the map can be used for heuristic, illustrative, or analytical purposes, and the limitations and problems with map. In other words, discuss both what the map might reveal, but also what it may potentially conceal or distort. *Important*: At the end of the essay or embedded into the body of the essay should be the exported maps, with any post-processing required, such as you would want them to appear in a historical essay, with an appropriate caption. You will be marked in part on the presentation quality of the map and its ability to clearly and cleanly communicate what it sets out to show.
* 500 word appendix must also be uploaded to the MMS which describes the technical process by which you assembled the QGIS project and its layers. What did you do to create each of the layers? Where exactly did you get the data for each of the layers and why did you choose that data over possible alternatives? What other technical steps did you carry out in order to produce the project?
* If they cannot be uploaded directly to MMS individually or as a zip file, you must include a link to a place where the QGIS files can be downloaded (publicly accessible or shared Google Drive or Dropbox file link, or other file sharing resource) or else have submitted a USB drive on the previous meeting of class with the files.

**Scope**: The number of layers of data to include depends entirely on what map or maps are being created, that is what you are trying to show. It may consist of three or up to a dozen layers and may include natural coastal or topographical data, other features, and thematic data layers visualizing things. You may generate a single exported map if it is rich and complex, requiring a very significant amount of time in preparation or up to half a dozen different maps using different data or snapshots of data at a particular time if they can be used effectively for historical argumentation. Please consult with the tutor as your outputs become clear if you have questions about the scope.

**Database and Visualisation Project** (50%)

This assessment allows you to develop your skills at the assembly, cleaning, visualisation and reflection on data compiled from historical sources. You should extract data from your sources in the form of objects, people, organisations, people, etc. and compile these either into 1) an excel spreadsheet or 2) a series of edge lists or 3) a raw CSV file for import and manipulation in R or 4) a relational database that has been designed and normalised using good practices. Your work will be evaluated on the appropriateness of the selection of its output, account for the complexity of the chosen output (e.g. of these, (4) represents the most challenging output task), and whether the assembled material is sufficient for indicative findings for the explanatory essay (e.g. did you include enough, and appropriate kinds of data in the database to produce something useful).

Once you have created the above database you should produce some visualisations of your data in a way that is indicative of potential useful findings. There is limited time for this project so students are not expected to have an extensive or complete data, but there must be enough to at least demonstrate the possibilities (and limitations) or the material to make use of it in historical work. The visualisations may take a number of different forms (and several can be combined for this project, most effectively if they show different things) and should number 1-10 visualisations depending on the difficulty and complexity of the visualisations produced and what they can potentially be used for: 1) a collection of graphs and tables identifying patterns in the data. 2) Visualisation of the data through GIS output in the form of a chloropleth or other thematic map 3) Results (can be table form) from processing of the data in R, with the R code included, or text/corpus analysis, with any relevant instructions on how the output was produced or 4) a visualisation of a network using Cytoscape, Gephie, Palladio, or other visualisation tool

For Submission you must upload to the MMS:

* 1,5000-2,000 word explanatory essay which provides some basic historical background to the inspiration for the database and visualisation. It should discuss the way the database could be further expanded in terms of content, or developed in terms of the structure of the database or its possible outputs for use. It must also discuss the limitations of the database and the sources that underlie it, discuss the costs of quantifying the data from the sources in the way carried out, and similarly reflect on both what the visualisations can potentially reveal in terms of heuristic, illustrative, and analytic goals, but also what it may conceal or distort. *Important*: Embedded in the body of the essay or at the end of the essay you should produce the exported
* 500 word appendix discussing the technical process you used to create the database and visualisation. What decisions did you make in coding the data, where did you get the data from exactly, and what steps did you take in producing the visualisations.
* If they cannot be uploaded directly to MMS individually or as a zip file, you must include a link to a place where the QGIS files can be downloaded (publicly accessible or shared Google Drive or Dropbox file link, or other file sharing resource) or else have submitted a USB drive on the previous meeting of class with the files.

### Description

This digital humanities module provides students with an introduction to digital mapping in the form of historical GIS (HGIS) and computational approaches to the analysis of text. No specific technical knowledge is required before taking the course. Students will gain proficiency in the use of the software package QGIS to digitise historical maps, visualise and analyse geographical information, and produce rich maps for the illustration and heuristic exploration of historical information. In order to analyse large bodies of digitised text, students will learn regular expressions and named-entity extraction, carry our frequency and sentiment analysis, and the module will offer a survey of more advanced approaches such as topic modeling and the classification of texts. Finally, students will engage with scholarship in the critical digital humanities in order to critically evaluate the challenges and shortcomings of some of these methodologies.

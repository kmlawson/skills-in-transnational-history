## Managing Your Time During the Semester

You should expect to spend 12-18 hours each week in preparation for this seminar, with the other half of your weekly study time dedicated to your second module. I strongly suggest you set aside regular time every week, across at least two days of the week, that is especially allocated to this module in order to balance out the time you dedicate to it throughout the semester. Readings for the module will rarely involve more than half the time and you should never consider your preparation done for the week when the readings are complete. When taking notes on readings, focus less on the particulars of specific historical projects we may read about and focused on the methodologies, weaknesses and strengths regarding them, and bigger connections that connect to other readings and themes we have been discussing.

After you finish the readings for the week, use the remaining time you have set aside for source *research*, *experimentation*, *play*, and data *exploration*. This should eventually, but not immediately, be directed towards the broader end of becoming more familiar with the technologies introduced in the module, and most of all, helping you towards the development of the projects for your two assessments. Bring your ideas, as they develop, into the module discussion and share them with your fellow students as well. I cannot stress enough that this time is important. You will quickly find that, even when you have a firm project idea in mind, the sources settled, and a goal in sight, the majority of time in project development will go towards cleaning or preparing data, tinkering with software, googling obscure errors, watching YouTube tutorials or diving into bulletin boards about specific features or tasks you wish to perform, and, alas, it is *very common* to discover that a project is ultimately not viable with the original approach or data, and a switch in direction is needed. *A critical ingredient for success is, therefore: to allow time for failure and new beginnings.*

This is a computer screen intensive module. Though this may seem like an obvious point, it is worth reminding you here that it is not healthy to sit and stare at a computer screen for long periods. I suggest you try working in [periods of 25 minutes]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)) or so with the help of a timer, forcing yourself to get up and take a break regularly.

**Note:** We will have two meetings in week seven and in week nine to allow you more time to work on the final project after learning new skills. There will be no class in week ten or eleven, but office hours will be available in both weeks for you to come and ask questions.

## Optional Pre-Semester Preparation

If you would like to get a head start on the module and get a flavor for the module, consider trying some of the following tasks. If you have challenges with software installation and such, then don't worry too much, we will try to address some of these issues during the semester.

1. Read the short book by Franco Moretti, *Atlas of the European Novel, 1800-1900* and the fun but very informative book by Mark Monmonier *How to Lie with Maps*
2. Attempt to install [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) and [Cytoscape](http://cytoscape.org/) on your laptop
3. Attempt some of the tutorials at [Mapping and GIS for Historians](http://transnationalhistory.net/mapping/) - please note that these tutorials were developed for QGIS 2.x and some screenshots will not indicate the correct location of buttons, etc. in the 2018 Summer release of QGIS 3.x
4. Attempt to download and install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the free [R Studio Desktop OpenSource License](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). If you would like to get started with the world of R, consider a book such as *Learning R* by Richard Cotton, or any of the many online tutorials. *Note:* All the skills using R we will encounter in this module can also be done in the even more popular programming language of Python. If you think you might someday want to learn more programming, I'm happy to guide students towards resources that will allow them to do any of the module tasks in Python instead of R.
5. Browse and experiment with instructional materials at [A Gentle Introduction to QGIS](http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/), [Cytoscape Tutorials Wiki](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-tutorials/wiki), and if you have your access to St Andrews e-resources, try Chapter 1 of *Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature* ([library ebook](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-03164-4))

## Striking Out on Your Own

During the semester, you may decide that you want to deepen your knowledge and skill set in one or more of the technologies that are introduced in the module. A great many of the humanities scholars who have adopted some of the digital methodologies, tools, and techniques that we will encounter in this module do not have much in the way of formal training in computer science or related fields. With the exception of some short training courses in GIS and one-off sessions at digital humanities workshops and [unconferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference), I have no formal training in any of the skills in this module. Self-learning with online resources, videos, and books are a common way to expand your abilities in these fields.

## Week 0 - Orientation: History in Practice - Balancing Skills and Critique in the Digital Humanities   

Our emphasis in this course is on a set of skills related to GIS and mapping, social networks, and tools for the analysis of texts which, to obtain even a moderate proficiency in, would each require several modules. These are skills that are often associated with a field that has come to be known as the *digital humanities*. This module should be seen as a kind of taster course that allows you to encounter a world of digital tools and methodologies that may be useful for working with large collections of sources. You may decide that most or all of these methods are not appropriate for your own research going forward, but some exposure to them will greater afford you the opportunity to understand them and, when appropriate engage or critique other historical scholarship that makes use of them.

We will have three primary goals in this semester:

1. In three broad parts, we will learn some of the basic principles and techniques of *historical GIS*, digital techniques for *text analysis and distant reading*, and some basic *visualisation of social networks*. In the two major assessments of the module you will have the opportunity to practice some of the techniques learned or, in the case of the final assessment, alternatively write a critical engagement with scholarship that makes use of these methodologies. This part of the module is arguably both the most fun and the most frustrating: you should prepare yourself for the sometimes considerable amount of time spent sorting out what can often be rather trivial technical obstacles along the way. One of the goals of this course is to introduce you to the problem solving mindset required to face these difficulties by effective use of online resources.

2. In the case of each set of technologies, we will read some historical scholarship that has made use of these approaches in order to better see how they are being employed in scholarship today. When reading these texts, it is not important for you to focus on the particulars of each historical case, but instead pay close attention to how the historian makes use digital methodologies in the support of their argument. We will try to highlight what added benefits there are in employing these methodologies, either alone, or in mixed method scholarship that integrates them with other historical approaches.

3. Finally, this module will, throughout, introduce you to some of the work of what has been called the *critical digital humanities*. We will examine some of the powerful critiques that have been made of GIS both among historians and within the world of geography, where it had its biggest impact on scholarship. We will similarly examine critical discourses on other digital methodologies and in our discussions of the essays applying them that we read. Ask yourself, how much does the argument depend on the technological approach? What assumptions are made in setting the stage for the scholarship, in preparing the date, and in using the technologies? What are the costs implied, and the benefits gained? To what degree does the choice of methodology influence the kinds of questions asked and outcomes obtained?

**Preparation**

1. Examine two of the most famous maps cited in scholarship on mapping and GIS: Charles Joseph Minard's [map of Napoleon's Russian Campaign](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Minard.png), and the famous [cholera map](http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/snowmap1.pdf) of John Snow (you can read more about this here: [Map-making and Myth-making in Broad Street](http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/mapmyth/mapmyth.html). Then take a look at Joseph Priestley's [*A New Chart of History*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/A_New_Chart_of_History_color.jpg). Why have the come to be regarded as excellent historical examples of visualisations that communicate an idea very clearly? Where might a critique of them begin?

**Introductory Reading**

Moretti, Franco. *Atlas of the European Novel, 1800-1900* Verso 1998, p1-73 (Ch 1: The Novel, the Nation-State)
Harley, J. B. "Deconstructing the Map" in Michael Dear and Steven Flusty eds. *The Spaces of Postmodernity: Readings in Human Geography*, 277-288

**Suggestions for Play and Exploration**

* Browse the table of contents of some recent issues in the journals listed above in the *Resources to Explore* section and take note of titles you may want to revisit for inspiration for your future projects.
* If you haven't done so already, consider signing up for [Slack](https://slack.com/), and joining the Digital Humanities slack and Spatial Community slack channels, both good places to learn from others passively on the channels hosted or to ask questions.

## Week 1 - Introduction to Historical GIS and First Look at QGIS

This week will explore the field that has become known as Historical GIS, but more broadly the analysis of geographic data within the humanities in general, as well as some of its basic approaches and promise. Beginning this week, and continuing through week four, you will all be asked to give short presentations and prepare summary handouts on some examples of scholarship making use of GIS. We will set aside time this week to discuss the first project assessment, and some potential topics and sources that you may consider using for the assessment.

**Preparation**

1. If you haven't already done so, please try to **download and attempt to install [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)**. If you have problems, please make note of what issues appear and bring them in.

*General Tips Regarding Installation Problems:* Many of the multi platform open source applications out there these days make use of Java. Sometimes the version of Java pre-installed on your laptop (or, indeed, not installed or active) will be the key problem for getting the application to function smoothly. Installing or updating the appropriate Java version can often fix these issues. Also, if you find yourself presented with unusual error messages, searching google with a large part or all of the error message in quotation marks will often lead you to bulletin boards where people have faced similar issues and tried different steps to resolve the issue (though *please* evaluate recommended instructions on random bulletin boards with great care and ensure your machine is backed up before trying anything too elaborate!). The website [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/) often has useful discussions that address software issue. The [PC Classrooms](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/classrooms/) on campus should have QGIS 3.x installed and you may use them for your project work.

2. Using the Moodle, accessible via the module [MMS](http://mms.st-andrews.ac.uk/), **sign up to do two 3-5 minute non-assessed presentations** (not a minute more!) each on the "application" texts (one student per text) in the *Reading Selection* list below. These presentations will be given Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, or Week 4 (3 out of these 4 weeks). In addition, sign up for a third text which you will prepare a handout for, but not actually present on.

    * **Make a handout about each of the three texts** (two of which you will also present on) which is on a single or double-sided page. Submit the digital file for the handout as a PDF to the module Moodle for everyone's access before the class day that you will present on (the third text can be submitted anytime before week 4), and bring a printed copy for each student and tutor. On the handout: At the top of the handout put a full citation of the text followed by a short paragraph summarizing the argument and main features of the text. In a series of bullet points provide a brief outline or elaboration of points you will raise in your short spoken presentation, but not a verbatim text of the presentation - use this opportunity to practice the art of using a handout to complement your presentation, rather than stealing your listeners' attention by replacing it completely.
    * In the presentation **comment on the way that GIS or mapping was used** in the text. **Comment on what data was used for the project and what kind of effort might have been involved in preparing it** for GIS. **Were there any innovative or useful ideas to draw from the text as potential inspiration** for our projects? Was GIS used primarily for *heuristic* or *explorative* purposes, visualising sources or data in order to discover new questions and spot patterns to press the historical research forward? Was GIS employed using formal *analysis*, making use of quantitative methodologies, spatial statistics, or other algorithmic techniques (if so, list what specific ones were used in the handout) towards the end of making concrete spatial claims? Was GIS used primarily used for *illustrative* purposes, showing things referred to in the text, or showing in visual terms that which has been demonstrated by other means in the body of the text's argument? Note: many works do not fit well into any single category, but least make note whether there are any formal analytical GIS techniques at all used and what the added value of mapping or GIS is in the work.

**Suggestions for Play and Exploration**

* [Why All World Maps Are Wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIID5FDi2JQ) - watch this nicely composed Vox video on projections
* Play with the Mercator project and [nation sizes here](https://thetruesize.com/).
*  [Stanford Spatial History - Gallery of Projects](http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/gallery.php) - Visit this gallery of projects and examine a few of them for possible inspiration. Note that some of them merely have screenshots (many of them were once interactive with the plug-in Flash, which is no longer supported by its developers) and reflect on the problem of technological obsolescence on the web.
* Think about historical works that have impressed you or which you think are important for your area of interest. Are there aspects or sources which are or might benefit from a more spatially explicit approach? Do the works make use of maps or spatial visualization in an effective way? Could they have? If so, how might it have been done? What sources in your area of interest might lend themselves well to *heuristic* or *analytical* or *illustrative* use of maps and GIS?
* If your chosen readings for presentations include work that use analytic GIS techniques or spatial statistics, look up the method that was used and read more about it. Find out if/how the method can be done within QGIS, evaluate the strengths or weaknesses of the method. What kinds of assumptions does it make or other problems may arise?
* Look up one or more of the source bases used in some of the reading selections for presentations. Are any of them available online and easily accessible? Are sources like it or of the same type or class available in your area of interest and easily accessible? How might you get a hold of them for use in your own research?
* Start thinking about your first assessment and come up with half a dozen possible ideas to explore. Start chasing down information for it, or putting in inter-library loan requests if required.
* If you don't have it yet, apply for a SCONUL card in the library to help you get access to other large research libraries in the area. Consider getting a reader card at the National Library of Scotland and read up on the procedure for the use of the library, which is in Edinburgh.
* Look to the weeks ahead and identify techniques or skills that you think you might be especially interested in. Jump ahead and start learning in that area.

## Week 2 - QGIS: Basics and Georeferencing Historical Maps

We will open today with a discussion of some basic GIS terminology, concepts, and the components which are required for using GIS software. We will discuss the readings and have presentations on some applications of GIS in historical scholarship. We will then use most of the remainder of the time to work on learning the basic functionality of QGIS and the georeferencing of historical maps, which is a common task for many history projects. We will set aside class time to further talk about the first assessment, the expectations and share thoughts on what you wish to do in this regard.

Some of the QGIS basics we will work on, time permitting include:

* Adding and manipulating layers in QGIS
* Adding a simple layer with some points from a CSV file
* Importing shapefiles
* Adding basemaps
* Georeferencing and georectifying a historical map
* Adding additional features to a layer using a georeferenced or other basemap
* Basic querying of spatial data on maps
* Basic choropleth and graduated point symbol maps

**Preparation**

1. Please come to class with your laptop, having installed QGIS: [QGIS Download and Installation](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). In class we will together work through a few of the tutorials at [Mapping and GIS for Historians](http://transnationalhistory.net/mapping/tutorials/)
2. See the module Moodle for an updated list of YouTube videos to watch, along with some reference websites related to the QGIS techniques we will discuss. Please watch as many of the videos as you can, but you may skip those for techniques you are don't think you will ever need.
3. We will have some presentations today, see last week for more on how to prepare.
4. Some of the readings today point to the controversies over the use of GIS that created considerable tension within the field of Geography and has similarly sparked debates among historians. As these will emerge multiple times, consider noting down some of the main issues and different perspectives along with some of the major participants in these debates mentioned.
5. There are a number of technical concepts that arise this week. In fact, some of them show up in two or three of the readings so if you understood it clearly the first time, you can skim or merely review the understanding of the concept in the other readings. If they are not clear from the readings, consider looking into them a bit more: Data models, Vector and raster data, MAUP modifiable areal unit problem, Ecological Fallacy, Spatial autocorrelation, Generalization (in the context of GIS), Least cost path analysis, Epistemology and Ontology (in the context of GIS)
6. Browse the [David Rumsey historical map collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/) and especially its offerings in the areas of your interest.

**Suggestions for Play and Exploration**

As you learn some of the basics of using QGIS, especially the georeferencing of historical maps, creating new vector layers from the information, and visualising historical data with choropleth maps and graduated symbols, spend some serious time this week looking at potential sources out there: historical maps, historical data (already digitised and georeferenced, or not), spatial claims that can be illustrated or potentially questioned with spatial analysis. Also use play time to practice your skills working with georeferencing maps of different kinds. Start thinking about the kinds of obstacles and challenges you may face among your project ideas.

## Week 3 - QGIS: Techniques for Exploration and Analysis of Spatial Data

Our goal in this second hands-on QGIS session is complete a review of any techniques we didn't find time for in the previous week, and then continue with further skills from the list below. We will continue with the presentations that were signed up for in week one, but the readings for this week, which are generally in the area of critical GIS, will be mostly rolled into our discussion in week four.

Some QGIS techniques for today, as time permits:

* Creating a heat map
* Creating and using buffers
* Clipping, difference, and intersect
* Joins (Spatial, Table, Summary), Counting Points in Polygons, and Field Calculation
* Counting points in polygons
* Distance Matrix and Nearest Neighbor Analysis
* Depicting routes
* Creating a time series in QGIS + alternative online tools
* Some other geoprocessing techniques
* Exporting your map and post-processing
* GeoJSON and its uses


**Preparation**

1. [Mapping and GIS for Historians](http://transnationalhistory.net/mapping/tutorials/) - Please continue doing tutorials on our website
2. See the module Moodle for an updated list of YouTube videos to watch on the some of the above techniques, along with some reference websites related to the QGIS techniques we will discuss. Please watch as many of the videos as you can, but you may skip those for techniques you are don't think you will ever need. There are some exercises there for you to try in preparation for our meeting.
3. If you are giving a 3-5 minute presentation, please prepare it and if you haven't distributed it yet, submit and bring copies of a third chapter as instructed above.
4. This week you should should use almost all of your time practising QGIS, in play and experimentation and directly working on your project. Make progress this week to allow for changed directions, frustrations, or distractions to come.

## Week 4 - Thinking With/Against Maps and Spatial Analysis

For several weeks now we have been learning some very basic skills in QGIS and mapping. The promise of using GIS software for mapping, and the more advanced geographical analysis that becomes possible with it should be apparent. This week we will check with all of you on the progress in your work on the map project. We will discuss what constitutes effective use of maps and some of the ways that your map project will be evaluated. We will also have any remaining short presentations on the readings on applications of historical GIS. All of our remaining time, however, will be dedicated to a discussion of the various critical and theoretical readings we have done about GIS as a tool and methodology.

**Preparation**

1. Any remaining presentations should be prepared for and your additional handout should be submitted and distributed.
2. Be prepared to share your work on your map project so far, including the kinds of sources you are using or evaluating, what challenges you have had so far, and questions you might have.
3. Make substantive progress on your project.

## Week 8 - Networks: Introduction to Social Network Analysis and Cytoscape

This week begins with a more historical approach. The study of large groups of individuals, or individual objects, along with the network of relationships between them is very old in the practice of history. It was traditionally the field known as "prosopography" which we will examine more closely today, and analyse some of the decisions made in the course of developing the large databases behind some of these projects.

We will set aside class time to see what progress you have made towards a topic for the second assessment and what kinds of data you have begun to assemble for the database and visualizations.

## ERASE - Developing a Network Database

This week we'll discuss some of the background of what needs to be thought about prior to the creation of a database and some of the challenges at the outset. The basics of what a relational database is, and how it has come to dominate, until very recently, almost everything you interact with online. This week we will also have a closer look at some existing databases, how, they are structured, and what happens when you interact with them. We will also discuss how prosopographical efforts and biographical or event databases are now a key part of linking to heuristic map making and GIS analysis.

This week we will begin developing our own database, primarily with the software known as LibreOffice Base, and open source alternative to the desktop database software Microsoft Access. We will first construct a database using some example data, but then approach it with some of our own data. In addition, we will review your results from carrying out the below tutorial, using another approach to database creation and visualization from the Programming Historian.

## ERASE - Epistemologies of Quantification and the Critical Digital Humanities

This week we will again step back and reflect on some of the risks and theoretical problems with heavily quantitative approaches. We will discuss some of the literature on this in the "critical digital humanities" and then ask ourselves how our own projects for this module faced these issues.

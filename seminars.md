## Managing Your Time During the Semester

You should expect to spend about 20-25 hours each week in preparation for this seminar module (40 credits), with the remaining third of your weekly study time dedicated to your core module (20 credits). I strongly suggest you set aside regular time every week, across at least three days of the week, that is especially allocated to this module in order to balance out the time you dedicate to it throughout the semester. Readings for the module will rarely involve more than half the time and you should never consider your preparation done for the week when the readings are complete. The majority of your time should be spent on your projects. You don't need extensive notes on the readings, focus less on the particulars of specific historical projects we may read about but instead on the methodologies, weaknesses and strengths regarding them, and bigger connections that connect to other readings and themes we have been discussing.

After you finish the readings for the week, use the remaining time you have set aside for source *research*, *experimentation*, *play*, and data *exploration*. This should eventually, but not immediately, be directed towards the broader end of becoming more familiar with the technologies introduced in the module, and most of all, helping you towards the development of the projects for your two assessments. Bring your ideas, as they develop, into the module discussion and share them with your fellow students as well. I cannot stress enough that this time is important. You will quickly find that, even when you have a firm project idea in mind, the sources settled, and a goal in sight, the majority of time in project development will go towards cleaning or preparing data, tinkering with software, googling obscure errors, watching YouTube tutorials or diving into bulletin boards about specific features or tasks you wish to perform, and, alas, it is *very common* to discover that a project is ultimately not viable with the original approach or data, and a switch in direction is needed. *A critical ingredient for success is, therefore: to allow time for productive failure and new beginnings.*

This is a computer screen intensive module. Though this may seem like an obvious point, it is worth reminding you here that it is not healthy to sit and stare at a computer screen for long periods. I suggest you try working in [periods of 25 minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) or so with the help of a timer, forcing yourself to get up and take a break regularly.

## Optional Pre-Semester Preparation

If you would like to get a head start on the module and get a flavor for the module, consider trying some of the following tasks. If you have challenges with software installation and such, then don't worry too much, we will try to address some of these issues during the semester.

1. Read the short book by Franco Moretti, *Atlas of the European Novel, 1800-1900* and the fun but very informative book by Mark Monmonier *How to Lie with Maps*
2. Attempt to install [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) and [Cytoscape](http://cytoscape.org/) on your laptop
3. Attempt some of the tutorials at [Mapping and GIS for Historians](http://transnationalhistory.net/mapping/) - please note that these tutorials were developed for QGIS 2.x and some screenshots will not indicate the correct location of buttons, etc. in the 2018 Summer release of QGIS 3.x
4. Attempt to download and install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the free [R Studio Desktop OpenSource License](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). If you would like to get started with the world of R, consider a book such as *Learning R* by Richard Cotton, or any of the many online tutorials. *Note:* All the skills using R we will encounter in this module can also be done in the even more popular programming language of Python. If you think you might someday want to learn more programming, I'm happy to guide students towards resources that will allow them to do any of the module tasks in Python instead of R.
5. Browse and experiment with instructional materials at [A Gentle Introduction to QGIS](http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/), [Cytoscape Tutorials Wiki](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-tutorials/wiki), and if you have your access to St Andrews e-resources, try Chapter 1 of *Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature* ([library ebook](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-03164-4))

## DataCamp for Education

Before the module begins, you will be given an invitation email for free access to the courses available at datacamp.com. Your free access will be active from August for a period of six months and you may take the courses that are assigned through the online representation of this module on the platform. The platform is widely used for digital skills and data analyst training. If any of you are thinking of exploring careers in this area, I encourage you to use this (usually expensive) free account to learn a range of new digital skills.

[MO5161 DataCamp Classroom 2020](https://www.datacamp.com/enterprise/mo5161-skills-in-transnational-history-bc8f4ab5-68c5-41d7-9840-a1b0af43c73f)

DataCamp offers short interactive online courses (each of which can be completed in 3-6 hours of work), mostly showing you ways to employ the programming languages of R and Python for data science. It alternates between short film clips and interactive exercises in which you input code (I suggest using a desktop instead of tablet). During the semester, you will be required to either complete 4-6 short courses on DataCamp from a selection possible courses, or you may request an alternative research and writing task if you wish to avoid DataCamp altogether. While completion is required, your performance on these courses is not assessed with a formal mark.

All students are asked to complete: Introduction to R and Introduction to the Tidyverse. In addition, complete at least three additional mini-courses (* = suggested). There are a number of courses you will find in the "tracks" offered on DataCamp through our online class there. These include:

-	Text Analysis: Intermediate R*, Introduction to Text Analysis in R, Sentiment Analysis in R: The Tidy Way*
-	Strengthening R Foundations: String Manipulation in R with stringr*, Joining Data in R with dplyr*, Working with Data in the Tidyverse, Cleaning Data in R*, Communicating with Data in the Tidyverse, Working with Dates and Times in R, Importing Data in R (I, II), Data Visualization with ggplot2 (I, II)
-	Data Science: Introduction to Data, Modeling with Data in the Tidyverse, Correlation and Regression, Fundamentals of Bayesian Data Analysis in R, Exploratory Multiple and Logistic Regression, Foundations of Inference, Experimental Design in R, Survival Analysis in R
-	Spatial Analysis in R: Working with Geospatial Data in R, Spatial Analysis in R with sf and raster, Spatial Statistics in R
-	Network Analysis: Network Science in R: A Tidy Approach, Network Analysis in R

## Resources to Explore

As you do work on your projects you will find plenty of inspiration surveying the explosion of scholarship over the last decade or two. The following are some journals, hosts of projects, link hubs, and aggregators:

[*Digital Humanities Quarterly*](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/)  
[*International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing*](https://www.euppublishing.com/loi/IJHAC) (formerly *History and Computing*)

## Striking Out on Your Own

During the semester, you may decide that you want to deepen your knowledge and skill set in one or more of the technologies that are introduced in the module. A great many of the humanities scholars who have adopted some of the digital methodologies, tools, and techniques that we will encounter in this module do not have much in the way of formal training in computer science or related fields. With the exception of some short training courses in GIS and one-off sessions at digital humanities workshops and [unconferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference), I have no formal training in any of the skills in this module. Self-learning with online resources, videos, and books are a common way to expand your abilities in these fields.

## Week 0 - Orientation: History in Practice - Balancing Skills and Critique in the Digital Humanities   

Our emphasis in this course is on a set of skills related to GIS and mapping, social networks, and tools for the analysis of texts which, to obtain even a moderate proficiency in, would each require several modules. These are skills that are often associated with a field that has come to be known as the *digital humanities*. This module should be seen as a kind of taster course that allows you to encounter a world of digital tools and methodologies that may be useful for working with large collections of sources. You may decide that most or all of these methods are not appropriate for your own research going forward, but some exposure to them will greater afford you the opportunity to understand them and, when appropriate engage or critique other historical scholarship that makes use of them.

We will have three primary goals in this semester:

1. In three broad parts, we will learn some of the basic principles and techniques of *historical GIS*, digital techniques for *text analysis and distant reading*, and some basic *visualisation of social networks*. In the two major assessments of the module you will have the opportunity to practice some of the techniques learned or, in the case of the final assessment, alternatively write a critical engagement with scholarship that makes use of these methodologies. This part of the module is arguably both the most fun and the most frustrating: you should prepare yourself for the sometimes considerable amount of time spent sorting out what can often be rather trivial technical obstacles along the way. One of the goals of this course is to introduce you to the problem solving mindset required to face these difficulties by effective use of online resources.

2. In the case of each set of technologies, we will read some historical scholarship that has made use of these approaches in order to better see how they are being employed in scholarship today. When reading these texts, it is not important for you to focus on the particulars of each historical case, but instead pay close attention to how the historian makes use digital methodologies in the support of their argument. We will try to highlight what added benefits there are in employing these methodologies, either alone, or in mixed method scholarship that integrates them with other historical approaches.

3. Finally, this module will, throughout, introduce you to some of the work of what has been called the *critical digital humanities*. We will examine some of the powerful critiques that have been made of GIS both among historians and within the world of geography, where it had its biggest impact on scholarship. We will similarly examine critical discourses on other digital methodologies and in our discussions of the essays applying them that we read. Ask yourself, how much does the argument depend on the technological approach? What assumptions are made in setting the stage for the scholarship, in preparing the date, and in using the technologies? What are the costs implied, and the benefits gained? To what degree does the choice of methodology influence the kinds of questions asked and outcomes obtained?

**Preparation**

## Week 1 - Introduction to Historical GIS and First Look at QGIS

This week will explore the field that has become known as Historical GIS, but more broadly the analysis of geographic data within the humanities in general, as well as some of its basic approaches and promise. Beginning this week, and continuing through week four, you will all be asked to give short presentations and prepare summary handouts on some examples of scholarship making use of GIS. We will set aside time this week to discuss the first project assessment, and some potential topics and sources that you may consider using for the assessment.

**Preparation**

1. Examine two of the most famous maps cited in scholarship on mapping and GIS: Charles Joseph Minard's [map of Napoleon's Russian Campaign](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Minard.png), and the famous [cholera map](http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/snowmap1.pdf) of John Snow (you can read more about this here: [Map-making and Myth-making in Broad Street](http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/mapmyth/mapmyth.html). Then take a look at Joseph Priestley's [*A New Chart of History*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/A_New_Chart_of_History_color.jpg). Why have the come to be regarded as excellent historical examples of visualisations that communicate an idea very clearly? Where might a critique of them begin?

2. If you haven't already done so, please try to **download and attempt to install [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)**. If you have problems, please make note of what issues appear and bring them in.

*General Tips Regarding Installation Problems:* Many of the multi platform open source applications out there these days make use of Java. Sometimes the version of Java pre-installed on your laptop (or, indeed, not installed or active) will be the key problem for getting the application to function smoothly. Installing or updating the appropriate Java version can often fix these issues. Also, if you find yourself presented with unusual error messages, searching google with a large part or all of the error message in quotation marks will often lead you to bulletin boards where people have faced similar issues and tried different steps to resolve the issue (though *please* evaluate recommended instructions on random bulletin boards with great care and ensure your machine is backed up before trying anything too elaborate!). The website [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/) often has useful discussions that address software issue. The [PC Classrooms](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/classrooms/) on campus should have QGIS 3.x installed and you may use them for your project work.

3. Using the Microsoft Teams Sign-up tab, **sign up to do one 5-10 minute non-assessed presentations** (not a minute more!) each on the "application" texts (one student per text) in the *Reading Selection* list below. These presentations will be given Week 2, Week 3, or Week 4. In addition, sign up for a second and third text which you will prepare a handout for, but not actually present on. 

    * **Make a handout about each of the three texts** (only one of which you will present on) which is on a single or double-sided page. Submit the digital file for the handout as a PDF to the module Team Files tab for everyone's access before the class day that you will present on. 
    * In the presentation comment on the way that GIS or mapping was used in the text. Comment on what data was used for the project and what kind of effort might have been involved in preparing it for GIS. Were there any innovative or useful ideas to draw from the text as potential inspiration for our projects? Was GIS used primarily for *heuristic*, *illustrative*, or *explorative* purposes, visualising sources or data in order to discover new questions and spot patterns to press the historical research forward? Was GIS employed using formal *analysis*, that is to say, did it make use of quantitative methodologies, spatial statistics, or other algorithmic techniques (if so, list what specific ones were used in the handout) towards the end of making concrete spatial claims? 

**Required Readings**

* KNOWLES  Ch 1 "GIS and History" 1-27 (see Files)
* GREGORY  Ch 1 "GIS and its role in historical research: an introduction" 1-19
* GEDDES  Fragment of Ch 4, only section "Environmental Management" 104-111

**Suggestions for Play and Exploration**

* [Why All World Maps Are Wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIID5FDi2JQ) - watch this nicely composed Vox video on projections, and check out this [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/977/) on map projections.
* Play with the Mercator project and [nation sizes here](https://thetruesize.com/).
*  [Stanford Spatial History - Gallery of Projects](http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/gallery.php) - Visit this gallery of projects and examine a few of them for possible inspiration. Note that some of them merely have screenshots (many of them were once interactive with the plug-in Flash, which is no longer supported by its developers) and reflect on the problem of technological obsolescence on the web.
* Think about historical works that have impressed you or which you think are important for your area of interest. Are there aspects or sources which are or might benefit from a more spatially explicit approach? Do the works make use of maps or spatial visualization in an effective way? Could they have? If so, how might it have been done? What sources in your area of interest might lend themselves well to *heuristic* or *analytical* or *illustrative* use of maps and GIS?
* If your chosen readings for presentations include work that use analytic GIS techniques or spatial statistics, look up the method that was used and read more about it. Find out if/how the method can be done within QGIS, evaluate the strengths or weaknesses of the method. What kinds of assumptions does it make or other problems may arise?
* Look up one or more of the source bases used in some of the reading selections for presentations. Are any of them available online and easily accessible? Are sources like it or of the same type or class available in your area of interest and easily accessible? How might you get a hold of them for use in your own research?
* Start thinking about your first assessment and come up with half a dozen possible ideas to explore. Start chasing down information for it, or putting in inter-library loan requests if required.
* If you don't have it yet, apply for a SCONUL card in the library to help you get access to other large research libraries in the area. Consider getting a reader card at the National Library of Scotland and read up on the procedure for the use of the library, which is in Edinburgh.
* Look to the weeks ahead and identify techniques or skills that you think you might be especially interested in. Jump ahead and start learning in that area.

## Week 2 - QGIS: Basics and Georeferencing Historical Maps

We will open today with a discussion of some basic GIS terminology, concepts, and the components which are required for using GIS software. We will discuss the readings and have presentations on some applications of GIS in historical scholarship. We will then use most of the remainder of the time to work on learning the basic functionality of QGIS and the georeferencing of historical maps, which is a common task for many history projects. We will set aside class time to further talk about the first assessment, the expectations and share thoughts on what you wish to do in this regard.

Some of the QGIS basics we will work on, time permitting include:

* Adding and manipulating layers in QGIS
* Adding a simple layer with some points from a CSV file
* Importing shapefiles
* Adding basemaps
* Georeferencing and georectifying a historical map
* Adding additional features to a layer using a georeferenced or other basemap
* Basic querying of spatial data on maps
* Basic choropleth and graduated point symbol maps

**Preparation**

1. Please come to class with your laptop, having installed QGIS: [QGIS Download and Installation](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). In class we will together work through a few of the tutorials at [Mapping and GIS for Historians](http://transnationalhistory.net/mapping/tutorials/)
2. Watch some of these videos and try some of this yourself, some of it will be review material from last week: [QGIS 3 Tutorials for MO5161](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIJOEWFlTTsFJUjPbn6W65-XwkArra3mR) 
3. We will have some presentations today, see last week for more on how to prepare.
4. Some of the readings today point to the controversies over the use of GIS that created considerable tension within the field of Geography and has similarly sparked debates among historians. As these will emerge multiple times, consider noting down some of the main issues and different perspectives along with some of the major participants in these debates mentioned.
5. There are a number of technical concepts that arise this week. In fact, some of them show up in two or three of the readings so if you understood it clearly the first time, you can skim or merely review the understanding of the concept in the other readings. If they are not clear from the readings, consider looking into them a bit more: Data models, Vector and raster data, MAUP modifiable areal unit problem, Ecological Fallacy, Spatial autocorrelation, Generalization (in the context of GIS), Least cost path analysis, Epistemology and Ontology (in the context of GIS)
6. Browse the [David Rumsey historical map collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/) and especially its offerings in the areas of your interest.

**Suggestions for Play and Exploration**

As you learn some of the basics of using QGIS, especially the georeferencing of historical maps, creating new vector layers from the information, and visualising historical data with choropleth maps and graduated symbols, spend some serious time this week looking at potential sources out there: historical maps, historical data (already digitised and georeferenced, or not), spatial claims that can be illustrated or potentially questioned with spatial analysis. Also use play time to practice your skills working with georeferencing maps of different kinds. Start thinking about the kinds of obstacles and challenges you may face among your project ideas.

## Week 4 - Thinking With/Against Maps and Spatial Analysis

For several weeks now we have been learning some very basic skills in QGIS and mapping. The promise of using GIS software for mapping, and the more advanced geographical analysis that becomes possible with it should be apparent. This week we will check with all of you on the progress in your work on the map project. We will discuss what constitutes effective use of maps and some of the ways that your map project will be evaluated. We will also have any remaining short presentations on the readings on applications of historical GIS. All of our remaining time, however, will be dedicated to a discussion of the various critical and theoretical readings we have done about GIS as a tool and methodology.

**Preparation**

1. Any remaining presentations should be prepared for and your additional handout should be submitted and distributed.
2. Be prepared to share your work on your map project so far, if you are working on one, including the kinds of sources you are using or evaluating, what challenges you have had so far, and questions you might have. If you are working on a critical essay, be ready to share what direction you will be taking it.
3. Make substantive progress on your first project or essay.
4. Optional: Sometimes GIS is just overkill and creating a good map for illustration just needs some time spent tracing existing maps and adding your own features. For this, learning how to use Bezier curves is a great plus but requires that you have Vector drawing software. Commercial packages like Adobe Illustrator and Affinity Design among many other options work great but cost money. If you think you might want to trace maps, try learning how to use Bezier curves with the [Bezier game](https://bezier.method.ac/). Install [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) or download free version of [Gravit Designer](https://designer.gravit.io/) (or use the online version) and try tracing a simple map. A few more videos on how to use Bezier curves: [1](https://youtu.be/sagrkdmC_BI), [2](https://youtu.be/AAgWhnf_p3k), [3](https://youtu.be/uymedeE3mJE),[4](https://youtu.be/0rSDWJ_kncE)

## Week 5 - Text Analysis: Using the Command Line, Regular Expressions

The main task of today is to work with regular expressions (regex). The art of regex is an important foundation skill for mining textual information in many different contexts. A regex is a collection of symbols and characters used to identify a pattern, allowing you to search large bodies of text to *match* a designated combination of characters, words, or phrases which might, for example, simultaneously exclude other characters or words. We can do this directly through a web browser on certain sites but some dialect of regular expressions is built into powerful word processing software, many command line utilities such as *grep* and almost every programming language. We will also explore some of the other possibilities of using the command line on your computer, and software for OCRing documents that can then be searched or cleaned up with regular expressions. The various tasks below asking you to install software are optional. They are useful if you want to learn and try working with utilities on the command line (and you don't have a Mac) or work with Tesseract, but this will not be required, especially if you don't plan on doing any OCRing of historical documents, or plan to use other commercial OCR software.
  

\begin{center}
\makebox[\textwidth]{\includegraphics[width=6cm]{images/regular_expressions.png} }

\href{https://xkcd.com/208/}{XKCD Comic 208 "Regular Expressions"}
\end{center}

**Preparation**

1. Please install a good text editor that can support regular expressions. You can download the free Microsoft [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. There is a significant learning curve, but if you want to go full scale 1970s classic editing power, I am personally a daily user of (and this handbook was composed in) the powerful tool [VIM](https://www.vim.org/) (Mac OS X users see also [MacVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev) and [VimR](http://vimr.org/)). Its bitter arch-enemy (the two of them have been battling it out for supremacy in the geek community since 1976) is [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). 
2. Optional: Install [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki). This can be done easily via [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) on OS X, or the package manager if you will be using your VirtualBox as per instructions on the Tesseract github page. There is also a windows installation but I'm not familiar with its use.
3. In class we will work though the [Interactive Tutorial](https://regexone.com/) for regular expressions, but give it a try before coming to class. Read two somewhat silly examples of using regular expressions here: [Reformatting Confucius with Regular Expressions](https://web.archive.org/web/20160610173753/https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/reformatting-confucius-with-regular-expressions/38596) and [Finding the Women of Heimskringla with Regular Expressions](https://web.archive.org/web/20160610052659/https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/finding-the-women-of-heimskringla-with-regular-expressions/38631)
4. If you get the hang of regular expressions before class, try [Regex Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com/) (This only works in Safari and Chrome for me, try a different browser if it doesn't work for you).
5. There is very little required reading today. Take advantage of this time to work on your mapping project, due after independent learning week.
6. By this week, please have completed at least the Introduction to R course on DataCamp.

**Reading**

## Week 6 - Independent Learning Week

Week six of the fall semester is an independent learning week at St Andrews. Independent Learning Week is a learning week, not a holiday; it is integrated into the curriculum. The majority of time this week should be dedicated to the completion of your map project and on catching up on any reading you may have fallen behind on. In addition, please read the following short pieces to prepare for the transition to the second part of the semester:

## Week 7.1 - Introduction to R

This week we'll talk about R, which, together with the programming language Python are the two most commonly used programming languages for digital humanities, statistics, machine learning, and the whole world of data science. Although I personally enjoy Python more, and it is a more versatile programming language used in a wide range of tasks, my experience been that the welcoming environment of R Studio and the ease of adding and making use of libraries seems to be slightly better for new beginners. Anything in the module that can be done with R can be done with Python. Let me know if you want resources in that area and feel free to tackle the Python equivalents of our module on DataCamp instead of R. 

**Preparation:**

1. Attempt to download and install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the free [R Studio Desktop OpenSource License](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).  
2. If you haven't done anything except the Introduction to R on DataCamp, proceed with at least the Introduction to the Tidyverse course and consider making progress on other courses there.

**Required Reading**

JOCKERS  
Ch 1 R Basics

SILGE   
Ch 1 The Tidy Text Format  

**Further Reading**

Cotton, Richard *Learning R* O'Reilly (2013) - if you are thinking of doing your project with R, I would suggest buying yourself a copy of this for reference  
Wickham, Hadley et al *R for Data Science* O'Reilly (2017) - another book you might consider owning  
Davies, Tilman M. *The Book of R: A First Course in Programming and Statistics*  


## Week 7.2 - Text Analysis: Frequencies and Correlations

This week we will focus on some of the basic tasks carried out in text analysis: breaking texts down into tokens, getting frequencies for these in a text, and exploring correlations. You will *not* be required to use R in your final project, but take this opportunity to acquaint yourself with some of the basics of R and some of the ways it can be used. While here we use it for text analysis, it can also be used for regular expression search, GIS, network analysis and visualization, and many other useful tasks. 

**Preparation:**

1. The technical readings this week will reproduce some of what we try in class so don't worry if you can't make it through everything. We'll step through some of this within class. To take a break from R, download a raw text file from one of the books at [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and input it, or a piece of it, into [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which does some of the basic tasks that we are learning to do by other means.

## Week 8.1 - Text Analysis: Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis; Introduction to Alternative Tools

This meeting will continue the work we did in the last session. It is simply not possible to do more than a taster of either topic modelling or sentiment analysis but it opens the way to students who wish to explore more on their own, but also be aware of some of the debates that have emerged around the use of these techniques. We'll also look briefly at Orange as an example of a more interactive visual interfaced application to analyse text.

**Preparation**

1. You will not have had much time to prepare given this is our second meeting this week. Do you best to look through the online resources below and at least skim some of the technical reading. We'll try to do some of the technical tasks in class together.
2. Come to class with some ideas for your final project. As you think about what to work on, browse the work in the sessions to come. Especially start thinking about interesting primary sources that would be useful to approach with some of the methods we have been looking at unless you are going to be writing a critical essay.

**Suggestions for Play and Exploration**

If you are interested in using Sentiment Analysis in your final project, then go through Julia Silge's course on DataCamp: Sentiment Analysis in R: The Tidy Way. If you are interested in exploring Topic Modeling more, consider the DataCamp course Topic Modeling in R with Pavel Oleinikov.

If you are interested in alternatives to R (or Python) for text analysis, take a look at [Orange](https://orange.biolab.si/) which is a data analysis software package. If you are interested in the tool or looking for ways of analysing text without using R, take a look at some of its documentation or their [Youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClKKWBe2SCAEyv7ZNGhIe4g)

## Week 8.2 - Networks: Introduction to Social Network Analysis and Cytoscape

At one level the study of historical networks and relationships between people is at the heart of the sub-field of "prosopography" which we will examine more closely today. The heart of prosopography work has often been the work of developing a good database, which unfortunately is not something we will have time for here. We'll examine some examples, however, of prosopography projects and think about how social network analysis can be put to good use in historical work.  

**Preparation**

1. Please visit and look over the following websites:

[Prosopography Research](https://prosopography.history.ox.ac.uk/course_syllabuses.htm)  
[Domesday - Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England.](http://domesday.pase.ac.uk/)  
[Prosopography of the Byzantine World](https://pbw2016.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/)  
[China Biographical Database Project](http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k16229)  

2. Please attempt to install [Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/) on your laptop if you can and look over some of these [Cytoscape Tutorials](https://github.com/miriamposner/cytoscape_tutorials)

**Suggestions for Play and Exploration**

If you are interested in exploring more quantitative approaches to Network Analysis, using R, then you can explore the DataCamp courses for this in R (Network Analysis in R, Network Science in R: A Tidy Approach). I would also suggest you take a look at Barabási's textbook *Network Science* to tackle the methodological foundations.

## Week 9 - Mapping Texts and Networks; Mediums for Sharing Your Work

This final meeting will discuss some ways that maps, texts, and networks can be combined and visualised together. We'll talk about the problem of preservation in the digital realm, and discuss again some of the critical discourses around the digital humanities.

**Preparation**

1. Focus your efforts on developing ideas for the final project and ask questions in class if you want help with ideas or direction
2. Some tools to explore:
    * [Palladio](https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/)
    * [Recogito](https://recogito.pelagios.org/)
    * [InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com/) or [Textexture](https://textexture.com/)
3. Take a look at [Cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org/), a way to put your network graphs online and make them interactive.
4. Prepare for a discussion about the problem of the maintenance and longevity of formats, outputs and software in the digital world. Think about the example of [Gephi](https://gephi.org/). Look at the history of commits to the open source software Gephi: [Gephi Github Commit History](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/commits/master), the [Gephi Release History](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Releases) and the [Github Insights](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/graphs/contributors) for the project. What observations can we make about the history and the health of the software? What concerns might we have about its future? Is it as easy to gauge the health of [Cytoscape](https://github.com/cytoscape) from their GitHub repositories? What about their [Release Notes](http://www.cytoscape.org/releasenotes.html) and their [Roadmap](http://www.cytoscape.org/roadmap.html)?

## Week 10 and Week 11

There are no formal meetings during these two weeks, but I'll be available at the regular class time for an open office hour. This is to allow you more time to focus in on the approaches from the previous weeks of most interest to you. Make use now of the further reading, examples of scholarship, and "strike out on your own" section to further develop your understanding and proficiency in the direction you want to go. I cannot stress enough how important experimentation, fruitful failures, and making good use of digital research skills in helping you to deepen your skills.

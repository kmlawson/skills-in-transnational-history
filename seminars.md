## Ebooks and Resources ##

Many of the texts are available with links within this sourcebook, accessible through the St Andrews e-resources or elsewhere online. If links are not working, please do let me know, but also, please first contact the library help desk if books become unavailable (this has happened in the past when a bulk library subscription to a collection of works has expired and not been renewed, inadvertently removing access) or you have problem accessing a link to a library book.

## Optional Pre-Semester Preparation

If you would like to get a head start on the module and get a flavor for the module, consider trying some of the following tasks. If you have challenges with software installation and such, then don't worry too much, we will try to address some of these issues during the semester.

1. Read the short book by Franco Moretti, *Atlas of the European Novel, 1800-1900*
2. Attempt to install [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) on your laptop:
3. Attempt some of the tutorials at [Mapping and GIS for Historians](http://transnationalhistory.net/mapping/) - please note that these tutorials were developed for QGIS 2.x and some screenshots will not indicate the correct location of buttons, etc. in the 2018 Summer release of QGIS 3.x
4. Attempt to install [Cytoscape](http://cytoscape.org/)
5. Attempt to download and install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the free [R Studio Desktop OpenSource License](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
5. Browse and experiment with instructional materials at [A Gentle Introduction to QGIS](http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/), [Cytoscape Tutorials Wiki](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-tutorials/wiki), and if you have your access to St Andrews e-resources, try  Chapter 1 of [*Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-03164-4) (library ebook)

## Managing Your Time During the Semester

You should expect to spend 12-18 hours each week in preparation for this seminar. I strongly suggest you set aside regular time every week, across at least two days of the week especially allocated to this module, in order to balance out the time you dedicate to it throughout the semester.

Readings for the module will rarely involve more than half the time and you should never consider your preparation done for the week when the readings are complete. When taking notes on readings, focus less on the particulars of specific historical projects we may read about and focused on the methodologies, weaknesses and strengths regarding them, and bigger connections that connect to other readings and themes we have been discussing.

After you finish the readings for the week, use the remaining time you have set aside for source *research*, *experimentation*, *play*, and data *exploration*. This should eventually, but not immediately, be directed towards the broader end of becoming more familiar with the technologies introduced in the module, and most of all, helping you towards the development of the projects for your two assessments. Bring your ideas, as they develop, into the module discussion and share them with your fellow students as well. I cannot stress enough that this time is important.

You will quickly find that, even when you have a firm project idea in mind, the sources settled, and a goal in sight, the majority of time in project development will go towards cleaning or preparing data, tinkering with software, googling obscure errors, watching YouTube tutorials or diving into bulletin boards about specific features or tasks you wish to perform, and, alas, it is *very common* to discover that a project is ultimately not viable with the original approach or data, and a switch in direction is needed. *A critical ingredient for success is, therefore: to allow time for failure and new beginnings.*

This is a computer screen intensive module. Though this may seem like an obvious point, it is worth reminding you here that it is not healthy to sit and stare at a computer screen for long periods. I suggest you try working in [periods of 25 minutes]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)) or so with the help of a timer, forcing yourself to get up and take a break regularly.

## Striking Out on Your Own

During the semester, you may decide that you want to deepen your knowledge and skill set in one or more of the technologies that are introduced in the module. A great many of the humanities scholars who have adopted some of the digital methodologies, tools, and techniques that we will encounter in this module do not have much in the way of formal training in computer science or related fields. With the exception of some short training courses in GIS and one-off sessions at digital humanities workshops and [unconferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference), I have no formal training in any of the skills in this module. Self-learning with online resources, videos, and books are a common way to expand your abilities in these fields.

## Week 0 - History in Practice - Strategies for Research in Transnational History   

Our emphasis in this course is on a small set of skills related to GIS and mapping, social networks, and tools for the analysis of texts which, to master fully, would each require far more time than a single module with very limited class time can offer for any degree of significant mastery. These are skills that are often associated with a field that has come to be known as the *digital humanities*. This module should be seen as a kind of taster course that allows you to encounter a world of digital tools and methodologies that may be useful for working with large collections of sources. You may decide that most or all of these methods are not appropriate for your own research going forward, but some exposure to them will greater afford you the opportunity to understand them and, when appropriate engage or critique other historical scholarship that makes use of them.

We will have three primary goals:

1. In three broad parts, we will learn some of the basic principles and techniques of *historical GIS*, digital techniques for *text analysis and distant reading*, and some basic *visualisation of social networks*. In the two major assessments of the module you will have the opportunity to practice some of the techniques learned or, in the case of the final assessment, alternatively write a critical engagement with scholarship that makes use of these methodologies. This part of the module is arguably both the most fun and the most frustrating: you should prepare yourself for the sometimes considerable amount of time spent sorting out what can often be rather trivial technical obstacles along the way. One of the goals of this course is to introduce you to the problem solving mindset required to face these difficulties by effective use of online resources.

2. In the case of each set of technologies, we will read some historical scholarship that has made use of these approaches in order to better see how they are being employed in scholarship today. When reading these texts, it is not important for you to focus on the particulars of each historical case, but instead pay close attention to how the historian makes use digital methodologies in the support of their argument. We will try to highlight what added benefits there are in employing these methodologies, either alone, or in mixed method scholarship that integrates them with other historical approaches.

3. Finally, this module will, throughout, introduce you to some of the work of what has been called the *critical digital humanities*. We will examine some of the powerful critiques that have been made of GIS both among historians and within the world of geography, where it had its biggest impact on scholarship. We will similarly examine critical discourses on other digital methodologies and in our discussions of the essays applying them that we read. Ask yourself, how much does the argument depend on the technological approach? What assumptions are made in setting the stage for the scholarship, in preparing the date, and in using the technologies? What are the costs implied, and the benefits gained? To what degree does the choice of methodology influence the kinds of questions asked and outcomes obtained?

## Week 1 - Introduction to Historical GIS

This week will explore the development of Historical GIS, but more broadly the analysis of geographic data within the humanities in general, as well as some of its basic approaches and promise. We will discuss Franco Moretti and chapters in as example of an experimental application in literature, and together spend some time examining and critiquing various more recent projects online.

We will set aside time this week to discuss the first project assessment, and some potential topics and sources that you may consider using for the assessment.

**Preparation**

If you haven't already done so, please try to download and install [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). If you have problems, please make note of what issues appear and bring them in.

*General Tips Regarding Installation Problems:* Many of the multi platform open source applications out there these days make use of Java. Sometimes the version of Java pre-installed on your laptop (or, indeed, not installed or active) will be the key problem for getting the application to function smoothly. Installing or updating the appropriate Java version can often fix these issues. Also, if you find yourself presented with unusual error messages, searching google with a large part or all of the error message in quotation marks will often lead you to bulletin boards where people have faced similar issues and tried different steps to resolve the issue (though *please* evaluate recommended instructions on random bulletin boards with great care and ensure your machine is backed up before trying anything too elaborate!). The website [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/) often has useful discussions that address software issue.

## Week 2 - Introduction to QGIS  

We will open today with a discussion of some basic GIS terminology, concepts, and the components which are required for using GIS software. We will also examine some of the range of tools, free and not free which can be used as desktop software, but also through a range of online tools for working with geographic data, creating rich maps with this data, and in more advanced software, carry out analysis on these geodata sets. We will discuss ways of finding and creating your own geodata, including some of the strategies for searching online for high quality datasets.

We will set aside class time to further talk about the first assessment, the expectations and share thoughts on what you wish to do in this regard.

## Week 3 - QGIS Continued; Georectification

Our goal in this second hands-on QGIS session is to discuss the art and challenges of georectification. This is the process of assigning coordinates in physical space to, in our case, locations on a historical map. We will learn how to carry this out to prepare a map in GIS software such as QGIS so that we may add layers that extract locations or objects on that map, both at large scales and small ones.

## Week 4 - QGIS - Map Design, Post-processing, and Deployment

This week is closer to cartography and moves beyond GIS software. We will discuss some of the principles of creating maps that are visually effective, maps that tell stories, and some basic elements and techniques. We will discuss the world of map editing beyond GIS software, using vector based software, whether the open-source application Inkscape, or commercial software such as Adobe Illustrator. We will discuss the relative benefits of working within QGIS and then editing or deploying your maps after some editing in another graphics application, or, when simple maps are all that are needed, working directly with a graphics application, or an online tool.

A portion of class time will be set aside to talk to show each other what progress you have made in your own QGIS project, what map layers you have created or combined, what maps you have georeferenced, and you will have a chance to receive feedback.

**Preparation**

Please continue and complete the tutorials at [Mapping and GIS for Historians](http://transnationalhistory.net/mapping/tutorials/)

Please attempt to install [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) on your laptop. Don't worry if this is unsuccessful but it will be nice if at least some students attend class with a functioning version.

Have a look at the Wikipedia entry for [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)

Take a look at this example of a highly detailed SVG map:

## Week 5 - Thinking With/Against Maps and Geographical Information

For several weeks now we have been learning some very basic skills in QGIS and mapping. The promise of using GIS software for mapping, and the more advanced geographical analysis that becomes possible with it should be apparent. However, this week we will shift to think more critically about some of the epistemological challenges that it presents and what limitations there are for historical GIS and geographic analysis of a quantitative kind when applied to spatial history.

We will set aside time towards the end of this seminar to talk about the second assessment for this module. We will discuss ways to build on existing work done on the QGIS project and essay or ways to shift to another project for the Database/Visualization assessment that may be useful in your disssertation research, for example.

## Week 6 - Independent Learning Week

Use this week to finish your Map Project and catch up on any reading you may have fallen behind on. Start thinking about how to transition into the database project and read over the requirements for the Database and Visualisation Project.

## Week 7 - Cleaning Data and Analysing Texts

This week will have two focuses. The first is to talk about some of the technological challenges of moving from textual narrative or other kinds of material embedded in historical sources, to digital data that can be manipulated, analysed and visualised. Already in week 5 and again in week 12, we will return to the critical questions of what is lost, transformed, newly created in this process, but the main goal is to look at some of the tools for cleaning data. Among these will be an introduction to Regular Expressions and a brief introduction to tools such as OpenRefine and Orange.

The second part of the class will introduce (but not delve into too much depth) into the broad world of text analysis and text mining in the form of a variety of fields such as corpus analysis, text encoding and markup, topic modeling, and making use of data extracted from text for maps and network visualisations.

**Preparation**

Review the tutorials available at programming historian and identify 1-3 of these that may be relevant to your own goals for the preparation and analysis of data. We will discuss them in class:

https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/

Please use this week to really make a jump on your second project, thinking about the topic, and more importantly, what kinds of sources might be used for our second exercise.

**Reference Reading**

## Week 8 - Prosopography and Networks in the Humanities

This week begins with a more historical approach. The study of large groups of individuals, or individual objects, along with the network of relationships between them is very old in the practice of history. It was traditionally the field known as "prosopography" which we will examine more closely today, and analyse some of the decisions made in the course of developing the large databases behind some of these projects.

We will set aside class time to see what progress you have made towards a topic for the second assessment and what kinds of data you have begun to assemble for the database and visualizations.

## Week 9 - Developing a Network Database

This week we'll discuss some of the background of what needs to be thought about prior to the creation of a database and some of the challenges at the outset. The basics of what a relational database is, and how it has come to dominate, until very recently, almost everything you interact with online. This week we will also have a closer look at some existing databases, how, they are structured, and what happens when you interact with them. We will also discuss how prosopographical efforts and biographical or event databases are now a key part of linking to heuristic map making and GIS analysis.

## Week 10 - Introduction to Tools for Database Development

This week we will begin developing our own database, primarily with the software known as LibreOffice Base, and open source alternative to the desktop database software Microsoft Access. We will first construct a database using some example data, but then approach it with some of our own data. In addition, we will review your results from carrying out the below tutorial, using another approach to database creation and visualization from the Programming Historian.

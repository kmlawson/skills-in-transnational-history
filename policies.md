## Guidelines

Your submitted work should meet the following requirements:

### Headers and Formatting

At the top of all your written work or on a cover page, please include:

* The date of submission
* The assignment you are submitting (e.g. Historiographical Essay, Empirical Research Essay, etc.)
* Your student number
* A title for your essay or project
* The total number of words including footnotes (use the word count feature of your word processor)

When formatting your assignments, please follow these guidelines:

* Add page numbers
* Use a minimum of 12 sized font
* Use a serif font (such as Times Roman, Georgia, Garamond), not a sans serif font (such as Arial, Helvetica, Verdana)

### Footnotes and References

Please follow the St Andrews School of History Style Sheet, available on the school website. This document, sections 1-4, contains extremely valuable information on how to compose your essay, including how to format your footnotes and bibliography. Please note that failure to follow the style sheet can result in penalties on the final mark for the essay.

### Online Submission and Late Work

Unless otherwise indicated, work will considered submitted by the date the document was submitted online on the MMS website for the course. If you are concerned that any given assignment was not correctly submitted to the MMS, you are free to email a copy of your submitted assignment to the module coordinator, if you like. In the event an assignment was not correctly uploaded to the MMS for some reason, but an emailed copy was sent in time, that date of submission will be used, but a copy will still need to be submitted to the MMS thereafter. This module follows the official School of History penalties for late work found in the PGT handbook.

### Word Limits

Assessed work with word limits should be always submitted within those limits. Writing in a clear and concise manner, and being able to structure and execute an argument that may be shorter than you feel is required is a skill that is of great use in academic fields as well as the workplace beyond. Please do not go over the limit and force yourself to work within them as a practice that will be important for writing assignments in your future careers. Please see the PGT handbook.

**Please Note:** The appendix for the project submissions has a minimum but no maximum.

### Academic Misconduct and Plagiarism

Academic integrity is fundamental to the values promoted by the University. It is important that all students are judged on their ability, and that no student is allowed unfairly to take an advantage over others, to affect the security and integrity of the assessment process, or to diminish the reliability and quality of a St Andrews degree. Academic misconduct includes *inter alia* the presentation of material as one's own when it is not one's own; the presentation of material whose provenance is academically inappropriate; and academically inappropriate behaviour in an examination or class test. For more information: 

[Academic Practice](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/students/rules/academicpractice/)

If you are unsure about the correct presentation of academic material, you should approach your tutor. You can also make use of the resources of CEED, which provides an extensive range of training on Academic Skills.

### Marking Scale

We use a 20 point marking scale for your assignments. For more on interpreting the marking scale, see the School of History marking scale for taught Postgraduates. Please see the PGT handbook.

### Absence from Classes

Attendance is a basic assessment requirement for credit award, and failure to attend classes or meetings with academic staff may result in your losing the right to be assessed in that module. 

Please read the university policy on self-certification of student absences:

[Self-certification of Absence](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/students/rules/selfcertification/)

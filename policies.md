## Guidelines

Your submitted work should meet the following requirements:

### Headers and Formatting

At the top of all your written work or on a cover page, please include:

* The date of submission
* The assignment you are submitting (e.g. Historiographical Essay, Empirical Research Essay, etc.)
* Your student number
* A title for your essay or project
* The total number of words including footnotes (use the word count feature of your word processor)

When formatting your assignments, please follow these guidelines:

* Add page numbers
* Use a minimum of 12 sized font

### Footnotes and References

Please follow the St Andrews School of History Style Guide, available on the school website:

[School of History Style Guide](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/assets/university/schools/school-of-history/documents/current-students/school-of-history-style-guidelines.docx)

### Extensions and penalties for late, long or short work

All final submission will be made online with final submissions to MMS. See the section on reflective posts for details on how these are handled. Please see the School of History guidelines for details about other relevant policies related to late, long or short work as well as details about extensions:

[Extensions and Penalties for Late, Long or Short Work](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/students/ug/assessment/extensions-and-late-work/)

### Word Limits

Assessed work with word limits should be always submitted within those limits. Writing in a clear and concise manner, and being able to structure and execute an argument that may be shorter than you feel is required is a skill that is of great use in academic fields as well as the workplace beyond. Please do not go over the limit and force yourself to work within them as a practice that will be important for writing assignments in your future careers. Please see the PGT handbook.

**Please Note:** The appendix for the project submissions has a minimum but no maximum.

### Academic Misconduct and Plagiarism

Academic integrity is fundamental to the values promoted by the University. It is important that all students are judged on their ability, and that no student is allowed unfairly to take an advantage over others, to affect the security and integrity of the assessment process, or to diminish the reliability and quality of a St Andrews degree. Academic misconduct includes *inter alia* the presentation of material as one's own when it is not one's own; the presentation of material whose provenance is academically inappropriate; and academically inappropriate behaviour in an examination or class test. 

**Note on use of Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Large Language Models such as ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, etc. are powerful tools that generate confident answers to user prompts. LLMs frequently produce blatantly, or sometimes more subtly false information, are unable to effectively preserve their train of thought, and susceptible to sometimes hilarious logical flaws as a result of their innate design. We are all in the process of adapting to the emergence of LLMs and any potential place in our research and writing. The wholesale generation of paragraphs of prose by an LLM for submission is not permitted and is a violation of the rules of academic practice. Students are expected to submit their own original work and are responsible for all errors of fact and reasoning. *You cannot trust anything an LLM tells you and must confirm the veracity of any historical claims it offers you.* The limited use of LLMs as part of your research and editing process is permitted (but is not recommended unless you are fully aware of their shortcomings) for the following purposes: 1) Their use in the early brainstorming stage as you are testing out ideas, making lists of possible avenues, and asking for broad overviews of topics to generate concrete hooks for more targeted research in more accurate sources. 2) To brainstorm possible structures for your writing 3) To solicit critiques of your writing at the sentence or paragraph level. 4) For suggestions on alternative phrasing. Again, for all the above points, you cannot assume LLM responses will be accurate, but asking for a range of possible responses may give you or trigger further useful ideas. Any shortcomings of your work are ultimately yours alone.

If you are unsure about the correct presentation of academic material, you should approach your tutor. You can also make use of the resources of CEED, which provides an extensive range of training on Academic Skills.
